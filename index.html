            <p>
              This particular comet is called C/2022 E3 (ZTF) and was discovered by astronomers in March 2022 at the Zwicky Transient Facility in California. It has been nicknamed “the green comet” because of its verdant glow, and is thought to have come from the Oort cloud – a collection of icy bodies that are believed to exist in the farthest-flung part of the solar system.

            <p>
              The Parker Solar Probe is a NASA space probe launched in 2018 with the mission of making observations of the outer corona of the Sun. It will approach to within 9.86 solar radii from the center of the Sun, and by 2025 will travel, at closest approach, as fast as 690,000 km/h, or 0.064% the speed of light.
